# RustyVault

## _A simple password vault living in your terminal_

RustyVault is a place to place your passwords for later use.

## Features

- Fully encryped using argon2 and AES-GCM encryption
- Add, delete, and edit passwords

## Installation

You can install it from crates.io

## Development

While everything is encrypted, I am no security expert. Future updates should focus on making sure everything is as secure as possible.

Contributions are always welcome!
